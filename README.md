# VulnerabilityAssessmentReport

In this project I aided a fake client by the name of Artemis Financial. This client had a RESTful web application programing interface and was seeking out my help in order to protect itself from external threats. 

I was very detailed when reviewing the clients needs in order to properly identify security vulnerabilities. I assessed the clients use and made a decision that nearly all areas of the vulneraility assessment process were of importance to this client considering there field of work. It was very important to code securely for this client as it is with any client because secure coding prevents future attacks which is of the upmost importance to a companys well being. If our clients were left with vulnerabilities and became exposed to an attack not only would their company look badly, but so would the company that delievered their security. Bad coding makes for a bad company. 

It can be difficult to scan through code, run a vulnerability assessment, and report a recommendation. Finding the vulnerabilities isn't difficult, but making the decision on what to actually use for a security measure can certainly be overwhelming. It is easy to go over the top with security measures just as it is easy to not be secure enough. There  is a fine balance for security measures that is dependent on client needs. 

To properly increase layers of security I had to assess what data the client was gethering/creating. Additionaly I needed to understand what the client was going to do with that data. Once I understood the client properly it was simple to add in security layers that made sense. I believe that interpreting your clients use and creation of data is a vital step in understanding what types of security their web application software will need. 

After completing steps to secure the clients web application I performed a dependency check with Maven to determine other vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through my actions. 

I believe that Maven is an excellent tool for deterrming risks and vulnerabilities to your software/ I will be using this tool in the future to ensure secure coding practices.

This assignment showcases my abilitiy to analyze a clients needs and requirements. It shows that I can understand a client and then type out a well informed breakdown of how to attack the problem at hand. This project is short, sweet, and well informed. I hope others find it the same.
